### 🚀 Introducing G-Rump: The AI Product Operating System

**The Problem:**

Product Managers spend weeks translating ideas into technical specs. Developers spend days writing boilerplate. The gap between "what we want" and "working code" is expensive and slow.

**The Solution:**

G-Rump bridges that gap. Describe your product in plain English, and our AI generates:

✅ Architecture diagrams (Mermaid, C4)
✅ Technical specifications (PRDs)
✅ Production-ready code
✅ Tests and documentation

**Key Features:**

🎯 **Intent Compiler** - Natural language → structured JSON specs
🏗️ **Architecture Generator** - Auto-create system diagrams
💻 **Code Generation** - Full-stack apps in minutes
🤖 **G-Agent System** - Multi-agent orchestration
⚡ **18x Faster Builds** - SWC + Rust compiler
💰 **60-70% Cost Savings** - Smart LLM routing

**Built for:**
- Product Managers who ship
- Technical founders building MVPs
- Enterprise teams standardizing architecture
- Developers tired of boilerplate

**Powered by NVIDIA NIM** for production-grade AI inference.

We're launching v1.0 today after 6 months of beta testing with 500+ early adopters.

### First Comment (Your Story)

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm excited to share G-Rump with you today.

**The origin story:**

As a technical PM, I was frustrated by how long it took to go from "product idea" to "working prototype." I'd write detailed PRDs, then wait days for engineering to translate them into code. Often, what got built didn't match what I envisioned because something got lost in translation.

I wanted a tool that could:
1. Understand product requirements in natural language
2. Generate architecture diagrams for alignment
3. Produce working code immediately
4. Iterate quickly based on feedback

That's G-Rump.

**What makes it different:**

Unlike code completion tools (Copilot, Cursor), G-Rump starts with architecture. You design the system first, then generate code. This "architecture-as-code" approach ensures technical decisions are visible and deliberate.

The "G" in G-Rump stands for "Generative"—but also "Guided." Our G-Agent system orchestrates multiple specialized agents (design, code, deployment) to handle the full lifecycle.

**NVIDIA Partnership:**

We're proud to be building on NVIDIA NIM for inference. The performance and cost optimizations we've achieved (18x faster, 60-70% cheaper) wouldn't be possible without their infrastructure.

**What's next:**

v1.0 is just the beginning. We're working on:
- Collaborative editing for teams
- CI/CD integration
- More framework templates
- Fine-tuning on your codebase

Try it out and let me know what you think! Happy to answer any questions.

## Hacker News Post (Alternative)

### Title
Show HN: G-Rump – AI that generates architecture diagrams and production code

### Text

G-Rump (https://g-rump.com) is an AI-powered development platform I've been building for the past year. It transforms natural language product descriptions into:

- Architecture diagrams (Mermaid, C4, ERD)
- Technical specifications (PRDs)
- Production-ready code (React, Node, Python, etc.)
- Tests and documentation

**The pitch:** Most AI coding tools (Copilot, Cursor) focus on code completion. G-Rump focuses on architecture-first development. You describe the system, get a diagram everyone can review, then generate code from that specification.

**Technical details:**
- Rust-based intent compiler (8ms parsing)
- SWC for 18x faster builds
- NVIDIA NIM for inference
- Multi-agent orchestration (G-Agent)
- 3-tier caching for 60-70% cost reduction

**Open source:** The core platform is open source (MIT). We offer managed hosting and enterprise features.

Happy to answer questions!
