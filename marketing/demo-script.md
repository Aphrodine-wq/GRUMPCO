# G-Rump Demo Script
## "The AI Product Operating System"
**Duration:** 2 minutes  
**Format:** Screen recording with voiceover

---

## SCENE 1: HOOK (0:00 - 0:15)

**[Screen: Black with text appearing]**

**VO:** "Most product managers can't code. Most engineers don't understand the business."

**[Screen: Show split screen - confused PM on left, frustrated engineer on right]**

**VO:** "The result? Projects that take forever, specs that get lost in translation, and MVPs that never ship."

---

## SCENE 2: THE PROBLEM (0:15 - 0:30)

**[Screen: Show messy Google Doc with PRD]**

**VO:** "This is a typical product requirements document. 20 pages. Ambiguous. Outdated the moment it's written."

**[Screen: Show engineer looking confused, Slack messages asking for clarification]**

**VO:** "Engineers spend more time asking questions than building. And the final product? Rarely matches what the PM envisioned."

---

## SCENE 3: THE SOLUTION (0:30 - 1:15)

**[Screen: Open G-Rump desktop app - clean interface]**

**VO:** "Meet G-Rump. The AI Product Operating System."

**VO:** "Just describe what you want. In plain English."

**[Screen: Click 'Generate Architecture']**

**[Screen: Mermaid diagram animates into view - boxes connecting, flow appearing]**

**VO:** "G-Rump generates a complete system architecture. Frontend, backend, database, APIs - all visualized."

**[Screen: Scroll down to PRD section]**

**[Screen: Document generates line by line]**

**VO:** "Then it writes a detailed product requirements document. User stories, acceptance criteria, data models - everything your engineers need."

**[Screen: Click 'Generate Code']**

**[Screen: File tree appears - React, Node.js, Prisma]**

**VO:** "And if you want... it generates the actual code. A working MVP. React frontend. Node backend. Database. Ready to run."

**[Screen: Show terminal running npm start]**

**[Screen: Browser opens showing working dashboard]**

**VO:** "From idea to working product. In minutes, not months."

---

## SCENE 4: VALUE PROPOSITION (1:15 - 1:45)

**[Screen: Side-by-side comparison]**

**Left side:** Traditional workflow - weeks of meetings, docs, revisions
**Right side:** G-Rump workflow - minutes to working code

**VO:** "What used to take weeks of meetings, miscommunication, and delays... now takes minutes."

**[Screen: Show testimonials appearing]**

**Text:**
- "Shipped our MVP in 3 days instead of 3 months" - Founder, TechStart
- "Finally, specs engineers actually use" - PM, ScaleUp Inc
- "I can prototype without hiring devs" - Indie Hacker

**VO:** "Product managers can prototype. Engineers can build. Founders can ship."

## PRODUCTION NOTES

### Visual Style:
- Clean, modern interface
- Dark mode (easier on eyes, looks premium)
- Smooth animations (don't rush)
- Professional but approachable

### Audio:
- Clear voiceover (can use AI voice if needed)
- Background music (subtle, tech/ambient)
- Sound effects for clicks (optional)

### Pacing:
- Don't rush Scene 3 - this is the product demo
- Let the architecture generation breathe
- Show actual code briefly, don't dwell on it
- Keep energy up in final CTA

### Alternate Hooks (if you want to test):
1. "What if you could go from idea to working code in the time it takes to write a Slack message?"
2. "The average startup spends 6 months building their MVP. What if you could do it in 6 minutes?"
3. "Product managers: stop writing specs engineers ignore. Start shipping code that works."
