# backend-web (archived)

This package was merged into the main **backend** (grump-backend) in Jan 2026. All routes and services (Stripe webhook, collaboration, analytics, templates) now live in `backend/`. Do not build or deploy this folder. It is kept for reference only.

See [docs/BACKENDS.md](../../docs/BACKENDS.md) for the single-backend architecture.
