# What is G-Rump?

G-Rump is an AI-powered development assistant that transforms the way you build software. It combines advanced language models with a structured development methodology to help you go from idea to production-ready code.

## The Problem

Traditional AI coding assistants are great for small tasks, but they struggle with:

- **Complex projects** - They lack context about your entire codebase
- **Consistency** - Generated code often doesn't match your project's patterns
- **Architecture** - They focus on code, not system design
- **Workflow** - No structured process from idea to deployment

## The Solution

G-Rump introduces the **SHIP workflow** - a structured approach to AI-assisted development:

1. **S**cope - Define what you're building and why
2. **H**ypothesis - Generate architecture and technical specifications
3. **I**mplementation - AI-assisted code generation with context
4. **P**roduction - Testing, verification, and deployment

## Key Features

### Intent Compiler

The Intent Compiler is G-Rump's secret weapon. It translates your natural language descriptions into structured technical specifications:

- System architecture diagrams
- Data models and schemas
- API endpoint definitions
- Implementation plans

### Multi-Agent System

G-Rump uses specialized AI agents that work together:

- **Architect Agent** - Designs system architecture
- **Coder Agent** - Generates implementation code
- **Reviewer Agent** - Validates code quality
- **DevOps Agent** - Handles deployment concerns

### Desktop Application

G-Rump comes as a beautiful Electron-based desktop application that runs on:

- Windows (64-bit)
- macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon)
- Linux (AppImage, deb, rpm)

## Who is G-Rump For?

G-Rump is perfect for:

- **Solo developers** who want to move faster
- **Teams** looking for consistent code generation
- **Architects** who need to document systems
- **Startups** building MVPs quickly
- **Enterprise** teams with complex requirements

## Philosophy

G-Rump is intentionally "grumpy" - it will push back on bad ideas, suggest better approaches, and ensure you're building things the right way. Think of it as a senior developer who cares about code quality and isn't afraid to tell you when something could be better.
