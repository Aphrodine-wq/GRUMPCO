# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We aim to address security issues in the latest release series. If you are using an older
version, please upgrade before reporting an issue unless the issue is clearly still present.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues via one of the following:

- GitHub Security Advisories (preferred)
- Email: security@grump.example

Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

## What to Include

- A clear description of the issue and impact
- Steps to reproduce (proof of concept if available)
- Affected versions or commit SHA
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations

## Response Targets

We try to acknowledge reports within 72 hours and provide a status update within 7 days.
Fix timelines depend on complexity and impact.

## Production Security Baseline

If you are running G-Rump in production, follow `docs/SECURITY_BASELINE.md` and
`docs/PRODUCTION_CHECKLIST.md` to ensure required controls are enabled.
